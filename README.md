A project from when I was initially learning HTML/CSS/Javascript for an assignment at Emily Carr University of Art and Design.
The UX is horrible, but I was new to code and didn't yet know how to make what I wanted.
Shift + Scroll wheel to cycle through the "tabs" on the lower page.
Leaving it as a placeholder until I need the web address for something proper.
